#### Nodes

Nodes provide you the ability to organize your content into logical groups. Grouping content into these collections does a couple of things for you. #1 content can be queried based off of the node it belongs to. #2 it makes it really nice to work with the data within the admin. Many CMSs just list out all of the content that matches a content type but Grasshopper allows you to take control of how many folders you can create and what kind of content will be stored within those folders.


Organize your data so that it makes sense for the content administrators, not just the DBA


Each node can be assigned permissions, perfect for sandboxing data in your application
