#### Users

Membership is a critical component to almost all applications. Grasshopper has the concept of membership built-in. Not only does Grasshopper handle logins and user data (fully extensible), but it contains a robust permissions mechanism that allows you to protect data based off of the application's requirements.

* Support for basic authentication as well as 3rd party logins like Google and others.

* User roles and permissions (global and folder level)

* Manages custom user profile data

* Emitting events when actions are taken on users
