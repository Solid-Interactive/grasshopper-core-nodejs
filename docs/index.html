                   Content Management Systems are too rigid. Most cloud database services don't offer a friendly way for your customers to manage their apps (without being a developer).
                   Building backend administrations is costly, time consuming, boring and usually a terrible user experience.
                   Use Grasshopper and stop building admins, speed up your development, and make your customers happy.
