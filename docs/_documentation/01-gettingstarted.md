### Getting started

Grasshopper will run in any environment that supports Node.js and MongoDB. This is great news for users hosting the application themselves or using services like Heroku, Engine Yard or any other PaaS (Platform as a Service).

#### Requirements

* Environment that can run Node.js. Node.js is released under the MIT license and has installation packages available for Linux, Windows and Macintosh.
* Instance of Grunt (JavaScript Task Runner) installed. This application is used for compiling the application.
* Access to a running instance of MongoDB. You can host this yourself or use services like MongoLab.
* Access to local file system or CDN like Amazon S3.
