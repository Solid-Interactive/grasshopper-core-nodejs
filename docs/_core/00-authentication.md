#### Authentication

Membership is a critical component to almost all applications. Grasshopper's authentication methods are fully extensible, and it contains a robust permissions mechanism that allows you to protect data based off of the applicationâ€™s requirements.

Supported Authentication Methods

* Basic: This is the typical username and password method
* Google: Allows you to authenticate with your Gmail account, for more information on implementing Gmail Oath [click here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/oauth_overview).

Check out our sample projects for examples of both of these authenication methods in working applications.
