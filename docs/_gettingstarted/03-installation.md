#### Installation

Installing Grasshopper is super simple. Once your machine is configured, creating a new project is as easy as typing `grasshopper fly`.

The installation process fully configures working instances of [core](https://github.com/Solid-Interactive/grasshopper-core-nodejs), [api](https://github.com/Solid-Interactive/grasshopper-api-js) and [admin](https://github.com/Solid-Interactive/grasshopper-admin) for you.

See the example of how to install the NPM and setup a new project. We assume that all of the prerequisite software is already installed.
