#### Installation

The Grasshopper system includes 3 parts, Core, API and Admin. Most deployments include all 3 of these parts and they build on top of each other.

Now we don't want you to have to worry about configuring these separately so we created a handy [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grasshopper-cli) that helps you get going.

Just install the [grasshopper-cli](https://github.com/Solid-Interactive/grasshopper-cli) npm and follow the provided instructions.

    npm install -g grasshopper-cli
