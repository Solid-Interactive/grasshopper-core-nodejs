<h4 id="setting-up-your-development-environment">Setting up your development environment</h4>

<p>If you are doing full stack development on Grasshopper you should setup all projects in the solution to work locally.</p>

<p>The grasshopper-admin project comes with a server directory that can run grasshopper-api and the grasshopper-api project loads in grasshopper-core.</p>

<p>It is really easy to setup local versions of each of the projects so that you can do all of your development without publishing npms.</p>

<p>The key is to link your local grasshopper-core and grasshopper-api npms to be treated as globals.</p>

<p>More information on the technique using <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html">NPM LINK</a> can be found <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html">here</a>.</p>

<h5 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h5>

<p>Make sure that you development machine meets the minimum <a href="documentation.html#requirements">REQUIREMENTS</a></p>

<p>To test locally, you will be running a node app from <code>/server</code>. This app will run an instance of grasshopper-api. The app must be configured to serve the correct data (local or remote).</p>

<p>The configs are pulled from the environmental variable <code>GRASSHOPPER_CONFIG</code> if available or the fallback <code>ghapi.json</code> file.</p>

<p>Setup <code>ghapi.json</code> in the <code>/server</code> directory of the <code>grasshopper-admin</code> project. This is the config file that has the server and database info for your local dev work and it is <code>.gitignored</code>.</p>

<p>For an example of what this should look like, see <a href="#projectconfiguration">CONFIGURING YOUR PROJECT</a>.</p>

<h5 id="development-server">Development server</h5>

<p>The <code>grunt server</code> task will start a local express server running the API. It will also start a watch for the files in the <code>admin</code> project. If you save a file then it will be updates and the page will be refreshed.</p>

<p>If you make changes to your local <code>core</code> or <code>api</code> projects. This just restart the node server process to apply your changes.</p>

<h5 id="when-you-finished">When you finished</h5>

<p>Once you are have finished your dev work on <code>grasshopper-api</code> or <code>grasshopper-core</code>, you should publish the npm or submit a merge request.</p>

<p>To test the new npm, you should unlink <code>grasshopper-api</code> and/or <code>grasshopper-core</code> and pull the dependency in from npm:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/workspace/grasshopper-admin/server
npm uninstall grasshopper-api
npm install --save grasshopper-api@[the newly published version]
</code></pre>
