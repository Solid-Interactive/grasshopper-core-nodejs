<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>Installing Grasshopper is super simple. Once your machine is configured, creating a new project is as easy as typing <code>grasshopper fly</code>.</p>

<p>The installation process fully configures working instances of <a href="https://github.com/Solid-Interactive/grasshopper-core-nodejs">core</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Solid-Interactive/grasshopper-api-js">api</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Solid-Interactive/grasshopper-admin">admin</a> for you.</p>

<p>See the example of how to install the NPM and setup a new project. We assume that all of the prerequisite software is already installed.</p>
